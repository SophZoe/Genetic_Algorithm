class Agent:
    """
     Class to represent an Agent in this simulated environment\n
     with various genetic traits and behaviours.

    Attributes
    ----------
    number : int
        unique identifier for agent
    \n
    energy : int
        current energy of agent
    \n
    genetic : dict
        genetic traits of agent
    \n
    position : touple
        current position of agent on board
    \n
    covered_distance : int
        distance covered by agent, starts at 0
    \n
    expelled : int
        number of times agent has been expelled, starts at 0
    \n
    flee_counter : int
        checks if agent is in flight mode, starts at 0
    \n
    consume_counter : int
        number of times agent has consumed food, starts at 0
    \n
    consumption_time : int
        time needed for agent to consume different food
    \n
    sick : bool
        initial health of agent, default set to false
    \n
    sickness_counter : int
        number of times agent has been sick, starts at 0
    \n
    sickness_duration : int
        duration of agents sickness
    \n
    previous_condition : int
        previous condition of agent, default set to none
    \n
    reproduction_counter : int
        number of times agent has reproduced with a partner, starts at 0
    \n
    parent_a : int
        unique identifier for agents parent A, default set to None
    \n
    parent_b : int
        unique identifier for agents parent B, default set to None

    Methods
    -------
    genedistribution():
        randomly sets the genedistribution of each agent based on predetermined genes
        in the global dictionary GENPOOL
    \n
    consuming_food(food_dict):
        adjusting health and status values of an agent based on food properties,
        which are predetermined through the food_dict and the agents unique genedistribution
    \n
    move(board):
        defines how the agent moves on the board considering the state it is in
        (linking the movement with it's energy, sickness and fleeing behaviour)
    \n
    search_food(board):
        finding food is defined through the agents gene 'visibility_range', if food is found it
        will be consumed, considering the agents unique genedistributions and intelligence
        (disease risk) and the presence of aggressive agents
    \n
    check_for_aggressive_agents(board, x, y):
        ability of an agent to check for agressive agents within a specified search radius
        from its given location; is called in the search_food method
    \n
    check_for_sickness():
        checks if and how long the agent is sick, if False agents go back to previous condition
    \n
    move_away_from_aggressive(board, aggressive_agents):
        agent will move away from aggressive agents, if any were found
        (if any were found with the check_for_aggressive_agents method), its food consumption
        is being interrupted
    \n
    reproduce(board, partner):
        agents that occupy the same position and have suficcient energy have a chance to reproduce,
        success is dependant on tribal affiliation, with a guarantee if they are frome the same
        tribe. succesful reproduction results in a new agent inheriting genetic treits
        from both parents (calling the genedistribution_through_heredity method)
    \n
    genedistribution_through_heredity(parent1, parent2):
        determines the genetic traits of an agent created through reproduction, combining traits
        from both parents, some selected at random (tribe, intelligence), others calculated
